Consider 100 locations along with their latitude and longitude in an excel sheet. 
Using this data we need to create clusters of locations that falls in the radius of 10 degree Latitude (as latitude lines are not equidistant). 
You need to calculate a spherical distance based on latitude. (Suggestion: Use Haversine formula to account for the Earth's curvature.)

Sample Example:
Input:

Output:
Location 6, and Location 10 will be in one cluster. 
Note: Do not use inbuilt functions to solve this problem.
